1. **Sentiment Aggregation**:  
   RAEF.AI scrapes and analyzes sentiment from Twitter, Reddit, and NewsAPI. Each source contributes to the final RFS score.

   Uses CoinGecko's 7-day price data to calculate volatility and normalize it into a 0-100 scale.  

3. **Historical Recovery Insights**:  
   Incorporates recovery rates from past crashes to refine predictions.  

4. **Weighted Formula**:  
   Combines sentiment, volatility, and recovery factors using weights:
