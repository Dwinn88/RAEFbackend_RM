## Overview

RAEF.AI is an advanced AI-driven platform designed to calculate the **Reverse Fear Score (RFS)** for cryptocurrencies. The RFS leverages sentiment analysis from Twitter, Reddit, and NewsAPI, combined with volatility and historical recovery data, to identify hidden opportunities in the market. Whether you're a seasoned trader or just starting out, RAEF.AI helps you make smarter, data-backed decisions by turning fear into profit.

The project includes:
- A Telegram bot (`raef_ai_bot.py`) for real-time sentiment analysis.
- A futuristic web interface for visualizing RFS and other analytics.
- A robust backend API built with FastAPI and Python for serving RFS data.
